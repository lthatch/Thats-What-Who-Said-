# Helmet impact detector 

data: https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-impact-detection/overview

Concussions are a huge problem within the NFL. I would like to be able to detect when players make contact with their helmet. Once detected, medical teams could take the player off the field to make sure they are not showing symptoms. Also, knowing when and where most helmet impacts occur, we can prevent future injuries.

Potential problems- I'm afraid this project might be outside of my abilites.

# Food nutrition using images

I would like to be able to see an image of a food (or multiple foods) and return its nutritional values (carbs, fats, proteins, calories). This would allow people to better know how much food they are consuming. I am having trouble finding a dataset with images. If someone has previously done a project like this, I would appreciate a lead or ideas for a dataset.

# The Office quote predictor

I love the office and can probably quote or at least tell you who said a certain line from any season, any episode. I would like to build a model that can do the same thing.
